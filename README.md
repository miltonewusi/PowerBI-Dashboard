# 🩺 Hypertension Dashboard — Data Analytics Project

Hypertension, often called the “silent killer,” poses a major public health threat. To unpack its impact within our local context, I built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** grounded in real-world survey data. This project demonstrates my ability to conduct field-to-report analytics—capturing the entire data lifecycle from collection to visualization.

## 📡 Data Collection

Data was gathered via a structured survey using **Kobo Collect Mobile App**. Responses were stored securely on the **Kobo Toolbox** server. A total of **602 individuals** participated, providing comprehensive information on age, sex, BMI, alcohol use, smoking habits, and more.

## 🔄 ETL Process

The data was exported as a `.csv` file and loaded into **Microsoft Power BI**. I used **Power Query** to:
- Clean and format raw data
- Normalize categorical variables
- Build custom columns and calculated measures using **DAX**
  
This streamlined the data into a structure ideal for visual exploration.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to surface insights on:
- **Hypertension prevalence** across age groups and BMI categories
- Associations between **lifestyle factors** (alcohol/smoking) and blood pressure
- Patterns in **systolic and diastolic** readings by gender

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The final dashboard includes:
- **Filterable visuals** (by sex, BMI, and age)
- **Correlation charts** for blood pressure readings segmented by sex
- **2x2 risk matrices** for smoking and alcohol use vs. hypertension
- Comparative visuals for **BMI and vital signs** across age bands

> Viewers can dynamically explore health indicators and risk patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🚀 Impact

This project provides a foundation for:
- **Policy targeting** of high-risk populations  
- **NGO campaigns** for education and early screening  
- **Public health insights** rooted in local evidence  

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **KoboToolbox Server / Kobo Collect Mobile Application** – data collection
- **Power BI / Power Query / DAX** – data cleaning, transformation, and visualization
- **CSV** – data import/export format
